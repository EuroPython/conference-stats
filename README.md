# Conference Stats

The goal of this repository is to gather the public conference information
from the many Python events we have in Europe, so new ones can have a good
understanding of who to contact for future events for sponsorship possibilities
but also for speaking opportunities.

The data will also highlight the companies/organizations that are helping the
most in Python conferences, similarly to the most active speakers.

# How to contribute?

You can visit any missing conference edition, and populate the JSON files
accordinly with the `YYYY-levels` information, and an array for `YYYY`
listing all the sponsors. See `sponsors.json` for more information.

Remember to submit a Pull Request with the information and adding the
conference and year to this README.

**Not enough time?**
You can open new issues by providing a URL for the conference,
sponsorship packages details and list of sponsors, so others can extract
the information. This would be helpful as well!
